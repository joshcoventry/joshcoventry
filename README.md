## Hi, I'm Josh 👋

I'm a software engineering manager based in Sydney, Australia with a 15 year track record of leading teams that build and maintain platforms powering some of the world’s highest-traffic websites.

I help companies...

📈 Scale software engineering expertise  
🤝 Build healthy software engineering communities  
💡 Increase ROI from software development  
📉 Reduce infrastructure running costs  
☁️ Migrate away from legacy tech  
🚀 Innovate and experiment using software  
⏱️ Increase cycle time & embrace effective delivery practices.  
🔐 Build secure, scalable & resilient software  

I specialise in managing high-availability production systems, overseeing full-stack teams of 20+ engineers, and driving best practices in hiring, onboarding and modern software development.

My expertise spans cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP), back/front ends written in Go, PHP, JavaScript, front end application frameworks (React), CDNs (Fastly, Akamai), and event-driven, scalable and modern software architecture.

With experience across hospitality, broadcasting, e-commerce, digital media, CRM, ePOS, and digital payments, I bring a well-rounded perspective from roles as a software engineer, technical lead, and engineering manager.

I'm best reached via LinkedIn. I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
