## Hi, I'm Josh 👋

🇬🇧 I’m currently leading software teams at BBC  
🇦🇺 I'm looking for software leadership opportunities in Sydney, Australia  
🧑🏻‍💻 I'm particularly interested in software quality, cost reduction, and performance of critical systems  
🍎 I have a small collection of old Macs and find the era of System 6/7 very interesting
